# TSFRESH features

This folder will contain feature files generated by `features_tsfresh.py`

TSFRESH is a package for extracting features from timeseries data: <https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh>

Note that our results rely on a bugfix to the Benjamini-Hochberg code in TSFRESH, which has not yet been merged into the main repository at the time of writing: <https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh/pull/570>
